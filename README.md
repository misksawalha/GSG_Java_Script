# Mastering JavaScript in 20 Days

This endeavor is a 20-day challenge dedicated to mastering JavaScript within an accelerated timeframe. The primary objective is to elevate proficiency in JavaScript, delving deep into its concealed intricacies. Concurrently, the aim is to refine adeptness in problem-solving using JavaScript and to spearhead the creation of innovative projects. The learning journey will be facilitated through the utilization of online resources, primarily the courses available on front-end Masters, supplemented by specific coding challenges on freeCodeCamp. 

Throughout each day of the challenge, a new daily README will be generated. This README will comprehensively encapsulate the knowledge acquired on that particular day. Links to these daily READMEs will be consolidated within this central page. Furthermore, any projects conceived and executed during this challenge will be meticulously documented and linked here as well.
