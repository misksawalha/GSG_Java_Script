## Classes & Prototypes

### Object dot notation : 
The dot notation is a way to access properties and methods of an object. Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings (or Symbols) and the values can be of various types, including other objects, functions, numbers, strings, etc. The dot notation allows you to access and manipulate these properties and methods.

### Factory function :
It's a way to encapsulate the process of creating objects, allowing you to define a blueprint for creating similar objects with specific properties and behaviors.

### Prototype Chain : 
In JavaScript, each object has a prototype, which can be either another object or null. When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain to find the property or method in question.

### hasOwnProperty:
used to determine whether an object has a property with a specific name as its own property 

#### New keyword :
Used to create an instance of an object from a constructor function
### Class :
The class keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a more structured and syntactically cleaner way to define and work with constructor functions and prototypes, facilitating the implementation of object-oriented programming concepts. Despite the class keyword, JavaScript still uses prototypal inheritance under the hood.
