## Scope: 
- where to look for things
- avaScript organizes scopes with functions and blocks
- Shadowing refers to a situation in programming where two variables with the same name exist in different 
scopes
### Function Expression Scope : 
A function expression scope refers to the scope within which a function is defined when using a function expression. A function expression involves defining a function within an expression, typically by assigning it to a variable. The scope of the function expression determines where the function can be accessed and used.

### Function Declaration Scope :
A function declaration scope refers to the scope within which a function is defined when using a function declaration. Function declarations involve directly declaring a function using the function keyword. The scope of a function declaration determines where the function can be accessed and used.

### Anonymous Function Expression :
An anonymous function expression refers to a function that is defined without a name within an expression. Anonymous functions are often used in scenarios where the function is only used in one specific context and doesn't need a globally accessible name. Function expressions, including anonymous ones, can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, or used in various ways in your code.

#### Why we should prefer named expression over anonymous : 
- Reliable function self-reference (recursion, etc)
- More debuggable stack traces
- More self-documenting code
