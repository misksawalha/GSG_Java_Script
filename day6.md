## Data Fetching & Promises
Data fetching involves retrieving data from a remote source, such as an API. APIs provide URLs that direct us to the desired data, and these URLs correspond to resources on the web.
#### Promises 
In JavaScript, promises play a crucial role. They are mechanisms used to handle asynchronous operations. Promises are used to manage the flow of asynchronous tasks, making it easier to work with data fetching, API calls, and other non-blocking operations.

##### The promises have three states :
 - Pending : still wating for value
 - Fullfilled : finally got the value
 - Reject : sorry could not get the value 

### Await : 
let us tell javascript to stop and wait for an asynchronous operation to finish

### Destructing :
is a fancy way of declaring multiple variables at once , by extracting values from an object with there property names

### Async :
used to declare asynchronous functions. Asynchronous functions are functions that can be interrupted and resumed at a later time.

### Modules : 
let us to split big code bases accross multiple files
##### **Module scope** : 
We cannot directly access local variables within a module. To utilize them, we must export and import the variables.

## Debuggin and Error handling:
 **Debuggin** : Debugging involves identifying and    fixing issues in your code. 
 JavaScript provides various tools and techniques to assist in this process:
 - Console Logging
 - Debugging Tools
  

 **Error handling** : preventing them from crashing your application

- Try...Catch
