## JavaScript Principles
 

#### Thread of execution
JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means it executes code sequentially, one instruction after another, in a single sequence or "thread of execution".

##### Functions :
- **Execution context** : refers to the environment in which a piece of code is executed. It consists of variables, functions, and other code-related constructs that determine the behavior of the code as it runs

### Call Stack : 
is a crucial concept related to how functions are executed and managed in a program. It's a data structure that keeps track of function calls during the execution of a script. When a function is called, a new entry is added to the top of the call stack. When a function completes its execution, its entry is removed from the top of the stack, allowing the control to return to the calling function.
