## Closuer
Is a fundamental programming concept that occurs when a function retains access to its containing scope even after the function has finished executing. In simpler terms, a closure allows a function to "remember" its surrounding context, including variables, even after the function has completed its execution.
 

##### **Lexical (Static) Scoping**:
In lexical scoping, the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code. A variable defined within a function is accessible only within that function and any nested functions within it.  


### Asynchronous JavaScript  : 
**Promises** :  are a fundamental concept in JavaScript used for handling asynchronous operations in a more organized and manageable way. They were introduced to make it easier to work with asynchronous code and avoid callback hell, a situation where multiple nested callbacks can lead to difficult-to-read and maintain code.

Promises has three possible states:

1. Pending: The initial state, representing that the operation is ongoing.
2. Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise now holds a value.
3. Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise holds a reason for the failure.

#### Callback queue :
part of the event loop mechanism, which is responsible for handling asynchronous operations and callbacks in a single-threaded environment

##### Callback hell:
Also known as the "pyramid of doom," refers to a situation in JavaScript where multiple nested callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations. This can lead to code that is difficult to read, understand, and maintain due to the deep nesting of functions. Asynchronous operations executed within callbacks can quickly become challenging to manage, making the code more error-prone and harder to debug.
